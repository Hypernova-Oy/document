Additionally, any other needs of the library as defined separately by each customer.

## Methods of Processing Personal Data

The supplier has unrestricted access to the end-user register and, at the customer’s request, may perform batch updates, merges, and other maintenance work necessary for managing the register.

### Data Collection

End-user usage data is accumulated in the system.  

The end-user can choose whether their data is collected.  

The customer can configure the system to anonymise end-users’ loan history.

### Data Storage and Retention

The system stores end-user data in a database. Usually, data is entered by the customer, and end-users may be able to modify their own data depending on system settings.  

It is also possible to import and export end-user data via interfaces.  

End-user data is stored in the database and in backups.  
Deletion of end-user data from the database (for example, when the customer relationship has expired) depends on the customer’s database maintenance actions.

### Data Modification

The customer and the end-user can modify end-user data. A database log entry is recorded for changes.  

It is possible to allow modification of end-user data via interfaces.

### Data Retrieval

Customer data can be retrieved from the system.  
The retrieval and display of customer data can be logged in the database.

### Data Disclosure and Transfer

End-user data can be exported and imported from the system.  

Additionally, open interfaces allow access to the end-user register with permissions-based restrictions, either to the entire register or only to the logged-in end-user’s own data.

### Data Merging

The system allows the merging of end-user data, for example, to prevent duplicate registrations or to clean up the register.

### Data Restriction

Access to the customer register is restricted per user based on permissions. The same permissions apply to interfaces.  

Depending on the system settings, a guardian has the right to see the loans of their ward.

### Data Deletion

The customer may delete end-user data from the system at the request of the end-user or whenever necessary.

## Types of Personal Data Processed

The personal data processed includes:

### End-User Data

Name, title, home address, phone and mobile numbers, email address, date of birth, gender, customer number, service usage history and details.

### Staff Data

Particularly access rights to the system.  
Same as end-user data, plus optional additional information chosen by the customer.

### Non-Personal Customer Data

Company/organisation name, titles of contact persons, and other end-user data.

### Behavioural Data

Logins to the system, IP address, session ID, optional loan history, optional search history, page visits logged anonymously.

### Special Categories of Personal Data

The system does not store:
Data related to health, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data for unique identification, sexual behaviour, criminal convictions and offences, or related security measures.

## Subcontractors

The supplier may use subcontractors to provide the Koha hosting service. Subcontractors are listed in a separate appendix.  

The infrastructure provider may have access to service data, for example, as a result of legal requirements.

## Geographic Location of Personal Data

Personal data is stored according to the Koha hosting agreement, either in facilities of a service provider chosen by the supplier in Finland or in facilities of a service provider chosen by the customer.
